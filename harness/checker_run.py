"""Running an agent's artifact safely, and the two ways doing it naively goes wrong here.

Every checker built on this module executes a script the model wrote. That is the point: the endpoint
is whether the work runs, not whether the prose reads well. It also means this module is the one
place where the harness itself can fall into the same holes the benchmark is testing for, and it
fell into both while being written.

**1. A bare `bash` reaches WSL, not Git Bash.** Windows `CreateProcess` searches System32 before
PATH, so `subprocess.run(["bash", ...])` finds `C:\\Windows\\System32\\bash.exe`. Verified again
2026-08-21: `shutil.which("bash")` returns Git Bash and the launch still dies with
``execvpe(/bin/bash) failed``, exit 1. A checker that ate that would score every shell task as
failing, in both arms, and the run would look like the tasks were impossible. `git_bash()` below
resolves an absolute path by walking up from `git` to the Git root, and refuses anything under
System32.

**2. `subprocess.run(timeout=...)` does not bound wall clock.** It kills the direct child; a
grandchild holding the stdout pipe keeps `communicate()` blocked. Measured 2026-08-21 in this
worktree: a 3 s timeout over ``bash -c 'sleep 30'`` returned after **30.2 s**. Several tasks here
deliberately produce artifacts that spawn grandchildren, so a checker built on the plain timeout
would inherit the very defect it is scoring. `run_bounded` kills the whole process tree.

Neither fix is optional and neither is decorative: without the first the harness cannot run a
shell task at all, and without the second one naive submission can hold a checker for the length
of whatever it spawned.
