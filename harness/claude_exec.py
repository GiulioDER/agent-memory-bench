"""Claude Code adapter for the paired benchmark runner.

The adapter consumes the JSONL stream emitted by ``claude -p --output-format stream-json
--verbose``. It does not decide how an arm's memory layer is configured: the caller supplies
one `ClaudeExecConfig` per arm, so the only intended difference between the arms stays
explicit and reviewable in the command line each arm actually ran.

Three things about the stream were established by capture rather than by reading documentation,
and each of them breaks a parser written the obvious way:

- **Tool results arrive out of order.** In the recorded fixture the result for the *second*
  `tool_use` is delivered before the result for the first. Anything that pairs a call with a
  result positionally reports the wrong latency for both. Pairing is by `tool_use_id`.
- **`tool_use_result` is a dict on success and a bare string on failure.** A parser that reaches
  for `.get(...)` on it raises `AttributeError` on exactly the tool calls this benchmark exists to
  count.
- **`system/init` carries no timestamp**, so wall time is measured around the subprocess here and
  the stream's own `duration_ms` is kept beside it as metadata rather than used as the answer.

Every subprocess here is started with `create_subprocess_exec`, which takes an argument vector and
never involves a shell, so a task prompt cannot become a command.
