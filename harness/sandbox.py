"""Restoring the same repository state for both arms, and proving that it was the same.

A paired comparison over real work needs the two arms to start from identical ground. That sounds
like a copy and it is not, because three things can differ without anyone noticing: the initial
commit's identity and timestamp, the line endings git writes into the working tree, and whatever
a previous session left behind in a reused directory.

So each session gets a fresh directory built from a tracked fixture, and the harness records a
**tree digest** for it. `harness/gate.py` refuses a pair whose two arms did not start
from the same digest, exactly as it refuses a pair that cannot prove the treatment was applied. A
difference in starting state would look like a treatment effect and there would be nothing in the
artifact to say otherwise.

A fixture is a directory under `tasks/<task_id>/` at the repository root:

    tree/     the committed state; everything here is added and committed
    dirty/    optional, copied OVER the tree after that commit, leaving those files modified

`dirty/` exists for any task whose whole point is an unclean working tree. Doing it as an
overlay rather than as a script keeps the fixture readable as data.

⛔ **Oracles live in `oracles/<task_id>/` at the repository root, beside `tasks/`, and are never
copied.** The endpoint is only meaningful while the input that decides it stays out of the
agent's reach.
