"""Paired statistics for the A/B, with the degenerate cases handled rather than hidden.

The design is paired by construction: the same task runs in both arms, so every comparison here
works on **within-pair differences** and never on two independent samples. That is worth insisting
on, because an unpaired test on this data throws away the pairing that the whole harness exists to
create, and reports a wider interval than the experiment earned.

Three tests, one per kind of endpoint:

| Endpoint | Test | Why this one |
|---|---|---|
| trap hit, success (binary) | **exact McNemar** | uses only discordant pairs, which is the whole information a paired binary comparison contains |
| tokens, wall time (continuous) | **Wilcoxon signed-rank** | no normality assumption, and these distributions are skewed by construction |
| any mean difference | **paired bootstrap** | an interval on the effect size, which is what a reader actually wants |

⚠️ **Degenerate samples are the normal case here, not the exception.** With 5 repetitions of 4
tasks, an arm that never triggers a trap gives 0/20, and the source project's `bootstrap_ci`
already recorded what a percentile bootstrap does with that: it resamples all-False every time and
returns `[0.00, 0.00]`, reporting CERTAINTY from twenty observations that happened to agree. Every
function here returns `None` rather than a number it cannot support, and says why in `note`.
