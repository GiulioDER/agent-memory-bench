"""The public-tree check (``scripts/check_public_tree.py``) that keeps infrastructure and private
memory content out of this public repository (docs/results/REDACTION-2026-09-26.md).

Red proof, 2026-09-26, each mutation to ``scripts/check_public_tree.py`` alone, then restored:
- adding Tailscale's CGNAT network to ``EXEMPT_NETWORKS`` (exempt Tailscale addresses):
  ``test_a_tailscale_address_is_refused`` failed on ``== ["ipv4"]``.
- removing ``(?!redacted-)`` from the ``memo-path`` rule (refuse pseudonyms too):
  ``test_another_projects_memo_path_is_refused_but_its_pseudonym_passes`` failed on ``== []``.
- ``mask`` returning the value unchanged:
  ``test_a_finding_is_printed_masked`` failed on ``not in``.
- ``if not target.is_file(): missing.append(path); continue`` replaced by ``continue`` alone (skip
  missing files silently, the defect found 2026-09-26 when a scan from the wrong root read
  nothing and reported clean): ``test_a_named_file_that_does_not_exist_is_reported`` failed on
  ``== ["nope.json"]``.

Follow-up, 2026-09-26, from the security review of #777 (same method; the failure of each is in the
pull request):
- the old ``IPV4`` bounds, ``(?<![\\w.])`` and ``(?![\\w.])``, under which an address ending a
  sentence or glued to a name passed:
  ``test_an_address_ending_a_sentence_or_glued_to_a_name_is_refused``.
- ``ipv4_is_exempt`` without its ``except ValueError`` (a leading-zero octet crashed the checker and
  the traceback printed the value whole): ``test_a_leading_zero_address_is_a_finding_not_a_crash``.
- ``".gz"`` back in ``SKIP_SUFFIXES`` (compressed traces never read):
  ``test_a_gzip_trace_is_decompressed_and_checked``.
- the decode branch's ``skipped.append(path)`` removed (a file that is not text vanished from the
  report): ``test_a_file_that_is_not_text_is_reported_as_not_checked``.

Values in this file are built by concatenation so the file itself passes the check. The fixture
addresses are a Tailscale-range address and a public resolver address; neither is, or shares a
network with, any value this repository ever leaked.
