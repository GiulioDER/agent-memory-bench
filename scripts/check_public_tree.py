"""Refuse infrastructure and private-memory content in files this public repository would publish.

Copied from GiulioDER/RE-call ``scripts/check_public_tree.py`` at 739f26ba; the only local change
is ``memo-body`` in ``RATCHETED`` (see its comment). The leak history cited below is RE-call's.

GitHub's secret scanning looks for credential formats. It does not look for what leaked here in
2026-08/09 (docs/results/REDACTION-2026-09-26.md): host addresses, SSH host-key fingerprints,
hosting server IDs, personal mailboxes, and whole memos from the private memory store captured as
retrieval-candidate text in committed experiment traces. This check does.

Rules (each finding names its rule; the value is printed masked, so a CI log on a public
repository does not republish what it caught):

* ``ipv4``: an IPv4 address outside loopback, the unspecified address, RFC 1918, link-local,
  TEST-NET documentation ranges and netmasks. Tailscale's shared CGNAT range is NOT exempt.
* ``ssh-fingerprint``, ``private-key``: an OpenSSH SHA256 fingerprint or a private key block.
* ``server-id``: a hosting provider server identifier (``vmi`` + digits).
* ``personal-mail``: an address at a consumer mail domain.
* ``memo-path``: a path into another private project's memory (``sentiment-agent/...``) that is not
  a redaction pseudonym.
* ``memo-body``: the bold Why and How-to-apply section headings every stored memo carries, or a
  memo's ``originSessionId`` with a session UUID.

* ``home-user``: a real account name in a home-directory path (``C:\\Users\\NAME``,
  ``/c/Users/NAME``, ``/home/NAME``, or a Claude Code project slug ``C--Users-NAME-``). Generic
  placeholders (``user``, ``runner``, ``alice``...) and anything in angle brackets pass.
* ``private-term``: a term from the maintainer's private deny list: host aliases, domains, private
  project and account names. The list is NOT in this repository, since publishing it would
  publish what it protects: it is read from the file named by ``RECALL_PUBLIC_TREE_DENYLIST``, one
  term per line, matched case-insensitively. A finding prints the term's index, never the term.
  Without the variable this rule is not checked, and the output says so.
* ``local-rules-file``: a tracked ``CLAUDE.local.md``, a maintainer's personal rules file.

Exceptions live in ``scripts/public_tree_allowlist.txt`` as exact values with a reason, never as
patterns or whole files. Lock files are skipped for ``ipv4`` only (four-part version numbers).
A ``.gz`` file is decompressed and checked; a file that is not text is listed as not checked, so a
clean result never hides what was not read.

``home-user`` and ``private-term`` are RATCHETED rather than zero-tolerance, because the tree
still held hundreds of such mentions when they were added (2026-09-26) in files due to leave it.
``scripts/public_tree_baseline.json`` records, per file, how many of each it had; a file over its
count, or a file with none recorded, fails exactly like any other finding. ``--write-baseline``
rewrites the record from the current tree, and its diff is the review: a count may fall, and a
rise has to be argued for in the pull request that makes it.

    python scripts/check_public_tree.py --staged   # files staged for commit (pre-commit use)
